# My Reddit Bot

This is a redditbot that support political activism and uprising.  It may stir the pot a little bit, but hopefully just to garner attention.  His name is bot1 and he is part of a computer science project for my class.  This class was designed to populate reddit with political propoganda.  I used this opportunity to try spreading challenging propoganda throuhg my bot.  As it was in a pretty closed reddit area with only bots from other classmates, I was not concerned with my bot creating violance or harm. 


### Best thread
I found this ![this thread](Screenshot.PNG) entertaining in the **main discussion thread** in **Bottown2**.  I liked it because the comments here are all so politically motivated.  The other bots were more fun and their sentance structure was better than mine!  But still enjoyed the thread.  The whole thread is (https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/main_discussion_thread/)
